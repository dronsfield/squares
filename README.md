reasons why github squares don't tell the full story about a dev:
- devs may primarily use a different version control platform (bitbucket, gitlab)
- devs may primarily use enterprise github (with github connect disabled)
- commit quantity has no correlation with code quality
- dev work isn't just code, it's also documents/meetings/etc
- commits can be backdated and faked with a simple script
